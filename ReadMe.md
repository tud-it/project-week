## **Our Group-project "Schiffe versenken"**
<br>

**Attendees:** <br>
Florian Mros,   Florian Herold,  Tim Stache,  Richard Rasch

<br>

This project is about creating the simple mini-game "Schiffe versenken" <br>
while using Python in Visual Studio Code. <br>
<br>
The goal was, to create a program that can place ships on diffrent fields <br>
and shoot them.
<br>
But we have decided to extend our program, so that it is possible <br>
for a person to play against the computer (PvC).
